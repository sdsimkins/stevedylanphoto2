                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>Steve Simkins began his photography journey back in 2015 when he bought his first camera, a Canon AE-1 with some film and all the gear required to develop and scan his own work. From there he taught himself fundementals and worked on mostly personal work, but gradually stepped into professional work with engagement and wedding photography in 2018. After a year of professional work he decided it was not a career made for him, and so now he only shoots personal work documenting his daily life or projects that peak his interest. He is happily married to his wife Madison and they recently had their first born Theo. In addition they have four cats that add lots of excitment to their lives. </p>
